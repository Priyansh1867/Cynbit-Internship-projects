Problem: Missed Meal Planning in College Life
Target Audience: College students in hostels and PGs

In hostels and PGs, students often skip meals due to unpredictable schedules, sudden outings, or lack of awareness about food availability. This leads to food wastage, dissatisfaction, and frustration among both students and kitchen staff. Students don’t have a way to inform kitchen staff in advance about their meal preferences or cancellations, and the staff has no idea how many students to cook for.

Solution: MealSync – Smart Meal Management App

MealSync is a simple app that allows students to “check-in” or “opt-out” of upcoming meals. Daily meal menus are displayed, and students can confirm participation with a tap. Cooks get real-time dashboards of expected headcount, helping reduce food waste and optimize preparation. Optional features like meal ratings, allergy tagging, and late-meal requests can be added.

Why It Can Work:
The solution benefits both sides: students get more control and better meals, and staff reduces waste and workload. It’s lightweight, mobile-friendly, and ideal for hostels, PGs, and even small offices. With minimal tech (mobile app + dashboard), it solves a real, daily problem in a smart, scalable way.
